# Project 1 - The Safe Haven App
The Safe Haven App is a platform that makes buying wigs easy for women going through chemotherapy. Our app includes an informational video on applying wigs and a map to find salons and professional stylist. Our app is dedicated to patients but also to those who would like to help by making donations via the app. “Safe Haven”  solves the need for education on how to apply wigs, support in applying if desired and also purchasing.
